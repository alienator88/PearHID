Easily swap keyboard keys with a nice SwiftUI frontend for IOKit.hid/hidutil


## Features
- Save/clear multiple key combinations at once
- Save to launchd plist to persist reboots
- Turn off persist in settings to only affect the current session and disable launch daemon
- Helper tool to perform the launchd plist editing without asking for user password each time
- Custom auto-updater that pulls latest release notes and binaries from GitHub Releases
